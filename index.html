    Plants are mainly multicellular organisms, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. Historically, plants were treated as
           one of two kingdoms including all living things that were not animals, and all algae and fungi were treated as plants. However, all
           current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria). By one 
           definition, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (Latin name for "green plants"), a group that includes the flowering plants, conifers
           and other gymnosperms, ferns and their allies, hornworts, liverworts, mosses, and the green algae, but excludes the red and brown algae.
           
           Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are derived from endosymbiosis
           with cyanobacteria. Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives them their green color. Some plants are parasitic or
           mycotrophic and have lost the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize, but still have flowers, fruits,
           and seeds. Plants are characterized by sexual reproduction and alternation of generations, although asexual reproduction is also
           common.

    Animals (also called Metazoa) are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals 
        consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula,
        during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has
        been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres 
        (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The kingdom Animalia
        includes humans but in colloquial use the term animal often refers only to non-human animals. The scientific study of animals is known as 
        zoology.

Most living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria include the protostomes—
        in which many groups of invertebrates are found, such as nematodes, arthropods, and molluscs—and the deuterostomes, containing both the 
        echinoderms as well as the chordates, the latter containing the vertebrates. Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the 
        Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian. Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species 
        during the Cambrian explosion, which began around 542 million years ago. 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been 
        identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago.
